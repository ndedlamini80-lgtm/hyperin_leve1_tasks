* used "hi" instead of my name
*unexpected zip file

Yes. It is possible that my computer is infected with malware because  opened the zip folde in the malicious email. An 
automatic malware could have installed itself when i clicked on the zip folder.

Educating employees about phishing, social engineering, and malware prevention plays a critical role in keeping an
 organization secure. Many cyberattacks succeed because attackers exploit human behavior rather than technical weaknesses,
 making employee awareness a key defense.
Phishing attempts often arrive as emails, text messages, or phone calls that look legitimate and trustworthy. Staff should
 be taught to carefully review sender details, be cautious of unexpected attachments or links, and watch for poor spelling
 or unusual wording. If a message asks for sensitive information or urgent action, employees should confirm its 
authenticity through official company channels before responding.
Social engineering attacks use psychological pressure, such as urgency, authority, or fear, to manipulate individuals into
 breaking security rules. Attackers may impersonate managers, IT personnel, or external partners. Training should encourage
 employees to slow down, question unusual requests, and strictly follow company policies when handling confidential
 information or access requests.
Fellow employees can avoid malware infections by practicing safe computing habits at all times. They should only download
 software and files from trusted, approved sources and avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments. Keeping devices
 updated with the latest security patches, using strong passwords, and never disabling antivirus protection is essential. 
Employees should also avoid using unknown USB devices and report any suspicious activity immediately
